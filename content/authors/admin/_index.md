Hi, I'm Guangliang(Brian) Yu. I'm currently a Master of Quantitative Management student at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. I received my Bachelor's degree from Wenzhou-Kean Unviersity with a major in Finance, minor in Mathematics.

I'm self-motived, task-oriented, and data-oriented. During my undergraduate, I took part in four research projects. I published three papers as the first author on IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital, EI, CPCI , topics covering ESG investing, higher education, unemployment rate, and air pollution. 

Now, I'm more focusing on business fields, using analtycal skills and business insights to solve the real world problem. I believe data is treasure and data analytcs can help a company stand out
